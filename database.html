                        <h1>Database Design and SQL</h1>
                        <h2>A database designed for a Town Youth Soccer Club</h2>
                    </hgroup>

                    <div class="image-left-erd">
                        <!-- <img src = "images/ERD.png" alt ="Entity relationship diagram"/> -->
                    </div>

                    <p>This database was created for the use of managers and coaches of a Town Youth Soccer
                        Club. The <b>use cases</b> include creating an account for the user (managers, coaches, parents
                        of players), entering and storing information on the players and other participants (see
                        Person entity), as well as entering attendence and grading each player's skill set for each
                        practice. Documentation includes all business rules necessary for modeling entity relationships.
                        A few more entities may be easily incorporated into the structure, such as travel
                        games that would record the games played by the players of the current town club with other
                        towns. Such relationship would have a M to N associative relationship with the player and 
                        therefore would require a bridging entity.
                    </p>

                    <p>Database contains 16 entities, 5 of which are in generalization/specialization 
                        relationship and the rest are in associative relationships. The design contains 
                        bridging entities where necessary to model M:N relationships. The database also 
                        has a history table that tracks changes in fees for annual participation and 
                        uniforms.
                    </p>

                    <p><b>Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)</b> above captures the structure of the database.
                        The diagram uses traditional UML style for outlining the relationships. 
                        <b>Specialization/generalization</b> hierarchy is represented by Person supertype and two
                        layers of subtypes. A Person can be either a Parent or a Player, but not both, hence
                        the relationship is {mandatory, or}. Next level down, a Parent is a supertype for 
                        both Coach and Manager (since both positions are filled by parent-volunteers). A parent 
                        does not have to fill any of the positions for his child to play in the club. Therefore
                        the relationship is {optional, and}.
                    </p>

                    <div class="image-left-stored-procedure">
                        <!-- <img src = "images/Player_SP.png" alt ="Entity relationship diagram"/> -->
                    </div>
                           

                    <p>SQL implementation includes stored procedures to populate tables as well as a 
                        trigger that records changes of fees in the history table once the fee amount 
                        changes. The project includes an Oracle SQL script that contains DDL to create 
                        and populate tables and three sample queries that feature aggregate functions, 
                        joins, and subqueries. A sample stored procedure is given here. It populates the table
                        Player. Since Player is a subtype of the Person entity, the procedure needs to update
                        both tables with the data. I also created stored procedures for populating Person,
                        Coach, and Payment tables. SQL script contains all these and additional procedures.
                    </p>
