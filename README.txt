1. Items that were added/changed since the presentation on Sunday:
    a. A separate contact page was added
    b. Navigation menu was fixed at the top of each page and visible at all times.

2. Pages that use Vue:
    a.java_project.html (click on the top image and hover over the second image)
    b.personal_vue.html (hover over the top three images on the left)
    c.web-dev.html (cards change opacity on hover)

3. Pages that use AJAX:
    a. python_3.html (click on the button to retrive lists of words)

4. This website is hosted on GitHub Pages at: https://ichervachidze.github.io

4. Known issues:
    a.while validating CSS files I encountered two mistakes:
        aa. contact.css line 63: padding-inline-start does not exists
        bb. style_sheet_2.css line 184: padding-inline-start does not exists
    I use that attribute to keep my submenu options aligned with menu options. Could not remove that
    attribute because the submenu layout would be changed drastically.

    b. Back to the top arrow in the red circle that you can find on almost every page in the right
    bottom corner looks much thinner and misaligned in Firefox web browser. It looks fine in Chrome 
    and Edge.
